  * Small, minimal cartesian charting library. That means no: pie chart, radial chart, combo charts, etc.
  * Target is to support scatter, line and column charts. Possibly support bar.
  * Follow vis best practices, so no stacked area charts.
  * Charts should be renderable on the server and the client.
  * Annotations should be possible on all layers.
  * Layers should be composable, so you should be able to plot data for a line chart on the same graph as a bar.
  * Chart objects should be programable, providing mechanisms for interaction between charts (eg small multiples).
  * Tooltips should be built in.
  * Charts should scale visual features up and down based on given rendering space.
